### The JEE buddies

Two friends, Aliya and Bhuvan study in different NITs. One day, they decide to send each other a message. Esha, who works at [AISHE](https://aishe.gov.in/), and didn't clear JEE, is jealous, and decides to see what they're talking about.

She observes that Aliya and Bhuvan are talking to their friend Duffy, who is eating a sandwich filled with the [world's most popular mayonnaise](https://www.hellmanns.com/ca/en/products/mayonnaise.html). Aliya and Bhuvan tell Duffy that they decided "p is 123457 and g is 11111". Esha is puzzled. She continues watching them in confusion as Aliya gives Bhuvan a shirt with the number "42569" on it, and Bhuvan gives Aliya a shirt with the number "106761" on it.

Can you help Esha find out which NITs Aliya and Bhuvan study in?
