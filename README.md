# Cyber Security Club Inductions

Welcome to our inductions for the year 2025. It appears we have successfully convinced you that we are a club worthy of your time and attention.
We have proved ourselves, and now it time for you to prove yourself.


# PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE DOCUMENT VERY CAREFULLY!

The induction process is divided into 2 rounds -
1. Round 1 - consists of submititing CTF-style tasks, with write-ups
2. Round 2 - shortlisted individuals will get called to an offline interview
This repository is for submitting the tasks for Round 1.

All prospective inductees will have 10 days to submit the tasks - till 11:59PM, 30 September, 2025.

The tasks are grouped by domain, and each individual must submit tasks in atleast 2 domains to continue. There will be bonus tasks for those who have time, want to challenge themselves, or want to show off their existing cybersec skills.

While we highly recommend submitting *ALL* the tasks in a particular domain, we are considerate to beginners, and it is fine if you submit a single task in each domain. Each domain will have a "dummy" task called Task 0, that is supposed to help you get aquainted with the absolute basics of the domain. This task isn't considered for submission, and a write-up is not at all necessary.

Make sure to submit your tasks, even if you "feel" they're wrong/incomplete. We value effort and attempts a lot, so don't be disheartened if you couldn't finish the tasks on time. Feel free to ask doubts, and hints in the group chat, but DO NOT share the solutions in the group or your friends, no matter how close they are. We expect you to also not ask solutions from your friends.

## Disclaimer

We do not forbid the use of generate AI, or using search engines at all. But we *highly discourage* it - use of AI has been linked to making you ["dumber"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08872). The problem with using AI lies in that you don't learn the mechanics of how to solve a problem, since it does that for you. AI can be used for doing "boring" tasks, such as finding the password from .bashrc history file, or something of that sort. But to use it to solve a task would be disservice to yourself; you don't learn anything. In the same way, we encourage using search engines to find more material on how to solve a task, but discourage using them for finding the flag. Even if you do stumble upon it, restrain yourself, and try figuring it out yourself. This way you actually learn something.
We hope that this small paragraph has convinced you on how to use AI. If not, be well aware that we do not entertain AI usage during the interview :) and we will make sure you know what YOU did.

## Submission

To submit, fork this repository, add your code under the respective folder, and a file called writeup-x.md, where x corresponds to the the task number. Make sure to add relevant screenshots, and references, as and when necessary.
