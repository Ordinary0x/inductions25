Esha continues to stalk Aliya, and follows her to her house (what a weirdo).

She notices that Aliya goes to her parent's room, and unlocks it with a key. She sees [this photo](./task2imgs/1.png) in her parent's room.

She then watches as Aliya goes to her own room, and unlocks it with the same key. She sees [this photo](./task2imgs/2.png) in Aliya's room.

Can you tell which engineering department Aliya is from, and where she might be from?
