- **Q1. Easy — Windows Binary**  
  [Download Task0.exe](./Task0.exe)
  A Windows executable that hides a flag using a simple transformation.
  Basic reversing skills will uncover the correct input.

- **Q2. Medium — Windows Binary**  
  [Download Task1.exe](./Task1.exe)
  The program takes a username, applies a custom hash routine, and outputs a hexadecimal value. 
  Your task is to figure out the correct transformation.  

- **Q3. Hard — ELF Binary**  
  [Download Task2](./Task2)
  A classic constraint-based crackme. 
  Solving it requires analyzing the conditions and developing your own external solver script to generate the valid input.

*Bonus for Task2 : You may also attempt basic binary exploitation and include screenshots of your process in the write-up.*
